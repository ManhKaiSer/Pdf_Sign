The Vendor does not warrant that use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error-free.

However, Secure Soft states that every reasonable effort has been made to avoid presence of any possible malevolent code in the SOFTWARE (including, but not limited to, viruses, trojans, root kits and/or spyware) and declares that to the best knowledge of competent experts of Secure Soft the SOFTWARE does not contain any such malware. Supplemental enhances and updates are subject to other contracts.
